This course completes general education requirements in French as a foreign language. The primary goal of this course is the development of a functional ability to use French. Emphasis is on vocabulary building, listening comprehension, cultural, social and historical knowledge of France, reading for information, speaking, and writing. Knowledge of the grammatical structures taught in the first three semesters is assumed but each chapter of the book provides the opportunity for individual grammar review. Grammar is studied through exercises and also associated with readings in French and with the re-writing of compositions. FREN:2002 is a language class and vocabulary, grammar, listening, reading, writing, and speaking will be stressed but at the same time French will be used as the medium by which we gain access to knowledge about the French-speaking world. Students are expected to attend class regularly, to turn in assignments (typed with double-spacing) on time, to hand in only their own work, unread and unedited by anyone else, to show initiative in the preparation of materials, and to work regularly toward class goals.\nThis course meets four days per week in the classroom for 4 s.h.  The remaining 1 s.h. is earned through completion of out of class activities that include (but not limited to) online lab assignments and written papers.",

Some knowledge of the grammatical structures taught in the first two semesters is assumed but there is some grammar in each chapter. Correct structures are practiced through exercises, readings, and writings. Classes are conducted in German.\nWe use the textbook “Stationen” and its online materials (Hawkshop at a special discount). “Stationen” combines engaging cultural topics with authentic readings and contextualized grammar in a unifying context. Each chapter revolves around a city or region in the German-speaking countries, taking you on a virtual exploration.  We use the accompanying video component that contains footage of videoblogs from eleven cities in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland and serves as windows to their diverse societies and contemporary culture.

Russian has the largest number of native speakers in Europe, it is one of the official languages of the UN, and it is the 10th most widely spoken language in the U.S. The Defense Language Institute classifies Russian as a “Level III” language, meaning it has a very high degree of difficulty and requires 789 or more hours of immersive instruction to attain intermediate fluency (See “Russian Life” May/June 2009).\nThis course is focused on helping you achieve the basic skills for successful communication: pronunciation, vocabulary, listening, speaking, reading, and writing. At the end of the second year, you will be able to pass the basic level of the TORFL, i.e., the “Russian as a Foreign Language,” exam. This test was designed as part of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages and is obligatory for those wishing to study at a Russian university.
